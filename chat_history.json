This will involve creating the main screens and components necessary for users to interact with the app's core functionality.\n*   **AdMob Integration:** Integrate AdMob to display banner ads, interstitial ads, rewarded video ads, and native ads at appropriate locations within the app.\n*   **User Interface:** Design a user interface that is visually appealing, intuitive, and consistent with the Phoenix app's branding.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f9f9f9` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#007bff` (Blue for main interactive elements)\n    *   Secondary: `#6c757d` (Gray for secondary interactive elements)\n    *   Accent: `#ffc107` (Yellow for highlights)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White for cards and containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#e9ecef` (Light gray for subtle highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\", \"Roboto\", or \"Open Sans\" for a professional look.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Set up a new React Native project with Expo.\n2.  **UI Structure:** Create the basic UI structure for the app, including the main screens and navigation.\n3.  **AdMob Integration:**\n    *   Install the `react-native-google-mobile-ads` package.\n    *   Configure AdMob with the app.\n    *   Implement banner ads in appropriate locations (e.g., top or bottom of screens).\n    *   Implement interstitial ads to display at specific intervals (e.g., after completing a task or navigating to a new screen).\n    *   Implement rewarded video ads to offer users rewards for watching videos.\n    *   Implement native ads to blend seamlessly with the app's content.\n4.  **Core Functionality:** Implement the core features of the Phoenix clone app.\n5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the app to ensure that all features are working correctly and that ads are being displayed properly.\n\nNow, I will instruct the coding agent to implement the plan and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\nAlso, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-15T14:55:30.076391"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a Phoenix clone React Native app with AdMob ads integration.

BannerAdComponent.tsx**\n- Added conditional imports using `require()` that only execute on native platforms\n- Component returns `null` on web, preventing any AdMob code from running\n- All AdMob functionality is wrapped in platform checks\n\n**2. NativeAdComponent.tsx**\n- Same approach as BannerAdComponent - conditional imports with `require()`\n- Returns `null` on web platform\n- Ad loading logic only executes on iOS/Android\n\n**3. AdMobService.ts**\n- All AdMob module imports are now conditional using `require()`\n- Every method checks `Platform.OS !== 'web'` before executing native code\n- On web, methods log messages and return early\n- The `showRewardedAd` method even simulates a reward on web for testing purposes\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe key technique used here is **conditional require statements**:\n- Instead of using `import` at the top (which always executes), I use `require()` inside an `if (Platform.OS !== 'web')` block\n- This ensures the native module is never loaded on web\n- The components and service gracefully handle the web platform by returning early or rendering nothing\n\nYour app will now:\n- \u2705 Build successfully on web (no more import errors)\n- \u2705 Show ads on iOS and Android as expected\n- \u2705 Gracefully skip ad functionality on web without crashing\n\nThe build error should now be resolved!
